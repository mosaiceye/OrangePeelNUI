# OrangePeelNUI
=============

## What is OrangePeelNUI?

OrangePeelNUI is a support library for experimenting with NUI technologies and Adobe Air. 
The main focus of this project is to connect NUI gestures and physics and apply them to game concepts, 
sound modules, art installations and overall interface experiences.

## Current Status
Just got started!

## Features
1. Main wrapper class for easy setup and integration with AirKinect and the Microsoft Kinect device.
2. Base class for setup of enriched views that support multiuser interaction.
3. Utility functions class for working with the Microsoft Kinect data and all that fun math stuff.
4. Main tracked user class with support for joint position and joint rotations.
5. Base sprite class for view setup in a PureAS3 project.
6. Basic 3D view class for support with Away3D.

## Future Features
1. Basic 3D view class for support with Flare3D.
2. Avateering support with Flare3D and Away3D.
3. Steering wheel support concept.
4. More gesture based detection.
5. Support for use with the Leap Motion device.
6. And much much more!
